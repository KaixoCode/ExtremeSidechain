# ExtremeSidechain
ExtremeSidechain is a simple and free VST plugin effect that does ring mod sidechaining. It's a very lightweight VST with no UI, you simply add it to the track you want to sidechain, add your sidechain input, and it will do ring mod sidechaining.


## Installation Guide
Installing this VST is very straightforward. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/KaixoCode/ExtremeSidechain/releases) tab, select the latest release, and simply download the VST3 file. You then put this VST3 file into your VST3 folder, it is usually located somewhere like `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`.

Unfortunately, I do not have access to a Mac OS device to compile it for Mac, so **there is currently only a Windows version available**.
